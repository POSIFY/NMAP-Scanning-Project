# NMAP-Scanning-Project
This project is aimed at identifying devices in a network, uncovering open ports, and checking for vulnerabilities. 

### Step 1
To scan our device (host) for open ports, we need to identify its IP address.
**Procedure**
* Start NMAP from the CMD terminal.
* Type "ipconfig". This will display all IP addresses; select the interface you are using, in this case, the wireless interface.
